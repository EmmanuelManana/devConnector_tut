To interact with the database, 
a model must be created for each resource (routes/api).
to create a model one needs a schema,
 which holds the fields we want for the resource in question.

 for (req.body) to work,one needs to init the middleware bodyParser.
 [data is sent to an end point(route), and is accessed using req.body]
