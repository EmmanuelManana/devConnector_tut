To interact with the database, 
a model must be created for each resource (routes/api).
to create a model one needs a schema,
 which holds the fields we want for the resource in question.

 for (req.body) to work,one needs to init the middleware bodyParser.
 [data is sent to an end point(route), and is accessed using req.body]


 // explaining the purpose fo each dependence;


 //read the documentaions of "express-validator";
 

 // to remember when creating my own mongoose
        => add/push collection (if not exist add user)
        => get/fetch collection (by userID/email)
        => delete collection (if exist delete user)

//jwt for user authentication, then permit (user) private routes.

//middleware theory


function name(name){

  var letters = /^[A-Za-z]+$/;

  if (name.value.match(letters)){
    return true;
  }
  else{
    return false;
  }
}

//rea vaya routes, T3 and C5.
